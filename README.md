# Godot_path_finding_problem_demo
 Minimal project to show problem with navigationpolygoninstance
 
 Clicking the mouse anywhere on screen should generate a path from the player (godot icon) to the location clicked.
 But the resulting path is strange (illustrated by the red line, white circles on the line indicate the path points)
